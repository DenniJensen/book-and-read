Information Systems: What Every Business Student Needs to Know takes a new approach to the required information systems course for business majors. For each topic covered, the text highlights key \"Take-Aways\" that alert students to material they will need to remember during their careers. Sections titled \"Where You Fit In\" and \"Why This Chapter Matters\" explain how the topics being covered will impact students once they are on the job. Review questions, discussion questions, and summaries are also included in each chapter to reinforce learning. The book is presented in four parts: About Information Systems: covers general information systems concepts that students need to know as they learn about real-world information systems Technology Fundamentals: supplies a foundation in information technology that fills the gaps most students have when they learn through trial and error Information Systems at Work: details the nitty-gritty of how actual companies use information systems in the real word Managing Information Systems: addresses the issues involved in selecting, developing, and managing information systems The text includes a running case study that follows two management information systems majors in college. As the two main characters study the information systems of a medical practice, students follow along and learn valuable lessons as they see how the case plays out. In addition to the running case study, each chapter also includes two mini cases that illustrate the concepts discussed in that chapter. Maintaining a focus on the essential concepts students must know before entering the business world, this book covers the subject of information systems in a manner that students will find accessible.","printType":"BOOK","pageCount":458,"categories":["Business & Economics"],"language":"en","thumbnail":"http://books.google.de/books/content?id=xHxjCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","isbn13":"9781482223712","isbn10":"1482223716"},{"title":"Technology in Education","subtitle":"A Twenty-Year Retrospective","authors":["Cleborne D Maddux","D Lamont Johnson"],"publishedDate":"2013-12-19","description":"Examine the history of the microcomputer and its impact on education!

What is the difference between a prodigy and a genius? Are geniuses born or made? What is creative vision and where does it come from? What are the secrets of talent? And why do great creators seem to have so many oppositions in their personalities? In this mind-expanding investigation of creativity, John Briggs reveals that there is no special trait of genius. Geniuses are not necessarily smarter or more talented than other people, but they give their attention to subtle nuances, contradictory feelings and perceptions that others experience and ignore. By focusing on sensory nuances, geniuses create themselves. Fire in the Crucible offers a compelling exploration of the roots of creativity and genius. Drawing on the lives and work of extraordinary scientists, artists, writers, composers, and inventors, Briggs shows how creative individuals exploit doubt and uncertainty, and the mental strategies and tactics they employ when they work. \"In asking about creativity,\" he writes, \"we are really asking about what is best, what is deepest in life.\" Fire in the Crucible draws the reader into an eye-opening journey through the inner workings of some of the greatest creative minds of all times -- and allows us to more deeply understand the nature of the creativity in our own lives and work.","printType":"BOOK","pageCount":382,"categories":["Psychology"],"language":"en","thumbnail":"http://books.google.de/books/content?id=dj26W-lw9EQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","isbn13":"9781609256579","isbn10":"1609256573"},{"title":"The Changing Frontier","subtitle":"Rethinking Science and Innovation Policy","authors":["Adam B.

Now is an appropriate time for such an undertaking. First, there is a growing belief that the U.S. national research and development system, like that of many industrial nations, is changing due to global competitive pressures and advancements in information technology and electronic commerce. Second, industry's R&D relationship with the academic research community is changing not only because of the global competition but also because of alterations in the level of government support of fundamental research. As a result, policy makers will need to rethink their approaches to science and technology issues. This volume is a collection of essays by scholars about innovative policy in the knowledge-based economy. By knowledge-based economy we mean one for which economic growth is based on the creation, distribution, and use of technology. As such, innovation policy in such an economy must enhance the creation, distribution, and use of knowledge that leads to the creation, distribution, and use of technology. This volume considers elements of an innovation policy: innovation policy and academic research, innovation policy in electronic commerce, and innovation policy and globalization issues.","printType":"BOOK","pageCount":457,"categories":["Business & Economics"],"language":"en","thumbnail":"http://books.google.de/books/content?id=PlGv1O5HCzUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","isbn13":"9780792372967","isbn10":"0792372964"},{"title":"Plastic Glasses and Church Fathers","subtitle":"Semantic Extension from the Ethnoscience Tradition","authors":["David B. Kronenfeld"],"publishedDate":"1996","description":"Meaning seems to shift from context to context; how do we know when someone says \"grab a chair\" that an ottoman or orange crate will do, but when someone says \"let's buy a chair,\" they won't? Somehow, in spite of this slipperiness, we usually understand each other in conversations, and have straightforward ways of querying each other when we sense a gap in understanding. We seem capable of using ordinary language to communicate with as much precision as we are willing to take the time and effort for--through attention to interactive feedback, and the use of paraphrastic modification, specification, and explication. In Plastic Glasses and Church Fathers, Kronenfeld offers a theory that explains both the usefulness of language's variability of reference and the mechanisms which enable us to understand each other in spite of the variability. His theory is rooted in the tradition of ethnoscience (or cognitive anthropology), a tradition which promotes an ethnography of explicit methodology and mathematically precise theory while remaining responsive to the complexity of particular cultures. Kronenfeld accomplishes three things with his theory. First, he distinguishes prototypic referents from extended referents. Second, he describes the various bases of semantic extensions. Finally he details how we use the situational context of usage, the linguistic context of opposition and inclusion, and the conceptual context of knowledge about the world to interpret communicative events.","printType":"BOOK","pageCount":273,"categories":["History"],"language":"en","thumbnail":"http://books.google.de/books/content?id=XjtyGrNnAWEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","isbn13":"9780195094084","isbn10":"0195094085"},{"title":"Persuasive Technology","subtitle":"Using Computers to Change what We Think and Do","authors":["B.

NetPay provides an off-line, anonymous protocol that supports high-volume, low-cost electronic trans- tions over the Internet. We developed three kinds of e-wallets to manage coins in a NetPay-based system: a sever-side e-wallet allowing multiple computer access to- coins; a client-side e-wallet allowing customer PC management of the e-coins, and a cookie-based e-wallet cache to improve performance of the client-side e-wallet c- munication overhead. Experiences to date with NetPay prototypes have demonstrated it provides an effective micro-payment strategy and customers welcome the ability to manage their electronic coins in different ways.

This collection is conceived as a series of dialogues and inquiries by leading scholars from both image- and sound-based disciplines. Chapters explore the history and the future of moving-image media across a range of formats including blockbuster films, video games, music videos, social media, digital visualization technologies, experimental film, documentaries, video art, pornography, immersive theater, and electronic music. Sound, music, and noise emerge within these studies as integral forces within shifting networks of representation. The essays in this collection span a range of disciplinary approaches (film studies, musicology, philosophy, cultural studies, the digital humanities) and subjects of study (Iranian documentaries, the Twilight franchise, military combat footage, and Lady Gaga videos).

It will provide a foundation for new teachers entering the area of technology, and also the opportunity for practicing teachers to keep up to date with research informed ideas about teaching technology. Technology in the curriculum has continually faced a range of challenges throughout its history in many counties. Often the basis of the challenges is the result of a lack of understanding about good technology practice. It is hoped that this book can encourage excellent practice in technology teaching and so increase the number of schools positively engaged with technology. The chapter authors are internationally respected and experienced educators who have been able to draw on both their teaching experience and their research in order to discuss a range of aspects of teaching technology. The book has been developed with an international audience in mind. While authors are naturally most familiar with their own country, efforts have been made to generalize from the principles of sound theory and research based practice to maximize applicability to local contexts. John Williams is the Director of the Technology, Environmental, Mathematics and Science Education Research Centre at the University of Waikato in New Zealand.

Very little has been written about what follows: the capture, possible extradition, prosecution, sentencing and incarceration of the cyber criminal. Originally published in 2004, this book provides an international study of the manner in which cyber criminals are dealt with by the judicial process. It is a sequel to the groundbreaking Electronic Theft: Unlawful Acquisition in Cyberspace by Grabosky, Smith and Dempsey (Cambridge University Press, 2001). Some of the most prominent cases from around the world are presented in an attempt to discern trends in the handling of cases, and common factors and problems that emerge during the processes of prosecution, trial and sentencing.","printType":"BOOK","categories":["Social Science"],"language":"en","thumbnail":"http://books.google.de/books/content?id=cFKMZg6AZKwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","isbn13":"9781139454810","isbn10":"1139454811"},{"title":"Discovering Computers & Microsoft Office 2013: A Fundamental Combined Approach","authors":["Misty Vermaat"],"publishedDate":"2013-07-18","description":"Combining computer concepts material from the best-selling Discovering Computers and step-by-step instruction on Office applications from Microsoft Office 2013, DISCOVERING COMPUTERS & MICROSOFT OFFICE 2013: A FUNDAMENTAL COMBINED APPROACH delivers the best of Shelly Cashman in one book for your Introduction to Computers course.

Join David Freedman as he takes you on a fascinating tour behind the scenes at laboratories around the world as top researchers race to create revolutionary \"thinking machines\" that may one day lead to a new form of intelligence. The subject of fantasy and skepticism for centuries—from William James's mechanical bride to 2001's Hal to Star Wars' R2D2—artificial intelligence has been limited to number-crunching computers that are \"smart\" only in highly specific domains like chess—until now. Brainmakers is an eye-opening, mind-expanding, and mind-blowing journey through laboratories engaged in cutting-edge research into neuroscience and robotics. Inside, you'll discover: MIT's Attila, a 3.6-pound, six-legged robot that learns as it interacts with its surroundings. Japan's efforts to grow brain cells on chips and construct a \"wiring diagram\" of the human brain. UCLA's \"robot farm,\" where robots will be \"bred\" for intelligence. In exciting yet accessible detail, Freedman shows how this research has moved into a new realm that transcends computer science, combining neuroscience, microbiology, evolutionary biology, and zoology. Modeled after natural rather than artificial intelligence, thinking machines may soon develop powers that rival—or exceed—those of the human brain.","printType":"BOOK","pageCount":224,"categories":["Science"],"language":"en","thumbnail":"http://books.google.de/books/content?id=EfBdq9DU2FMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","isbn13":"9781439142790","isbn10":"1439142793"},{"title":"Mindstorms","subtitle":"KINDER, COMPUTER UND Neues Lernen","authors":["PAPERT"],"publishedDate":"2013-09-03","printType":"BOOK","pageCount":276,"categories":["Science"],"language":"de","thumbnail":"http://books.google.de/books/content?id=RZikBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","isbn13":"9783034853576","isbn10":"3034853572"},{"title":"Computer Concepts and Programming in C","authors":["D.S.

With this volume, Patrice Degoulet and Marius Fieschi provide a comprehensive view of medical informatics and carry that concept forward into the realm of clinical informatics. The authors draw upon their experi ences as medical school faculty members in France, where informatics has long been integrated into the curriculum and where the French version of this very book has been used, tested, and revised. In intent and content, this volume stands as the companion volume to Introduction to Nursing Informatics, one of the series' best selling titles. For practitioners and students of medicine, pharmacy, and other health profes sions, Introduction to Clinical Informatics offers an essential understanding how computing can support patient care, clarifying practical uses and critical issues. Today medical schools in the United States are making informatics a part of their curriculum, with required medical informatics blocks at the onset of training serving as the base for problem-based learning throughout the course of study. In an increasingly networked and computerized environ ment, health-care providers are having to alter how they practice. Whether in the office, the clinic, or the hospital, health-care professionals have access to a growing array of capabilities and tools as they deliver care.

Haken"],"publishedDate":"2004-06-15","description":"This book presents a novel approach to neural nets and thus offers a genuine alternative to the hitherto known neuro-computers. This approach is based on the author's discovery of the profound analogy between pattern recognition and pattern formation in open systems far from equilibrium. Thus the mathematical and conceptual tools of synergetics can be exploited, and the concept of the synergetic computer formulated. A complete and rigorous theory of pattern recognition and learning is presented. The resulting algorithm can be implemented on serial computers or realized by fully parallel nets whereby no spurious states occur. Explicit examples (recognition of faces and city maps) are provided. The recognition process is made invariant with respect to simultaneous translation, rotation, and scaling, and allows the recognition of complex scenes. Oscillations and hysteresis in the perception of ambiguous patterns are treated, as well as the recognition of movement patterns. A comparison between the recognition abilities of humans and the synergetic computer sheds new light on possible models of mental processes. The synergetic computer can also perform logical steps such as the XOR operation. The new edition includes a section on transformation properties of the equations of the synergetic computer and on the invariance properties of the order parameter equations. Further additions are a new section on stereopsis and recent developments in the use of pulse-coupled neural nets for pattern recognition.","printType":"BOOK","pageCount":245,"categories":["Computers"],"language":"en","thumbnail":"http://books.google.de/books/content?id=-e6JfVRtLMwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","isbn13":"9783540421634","isbn10":"3540421637"},{"title":"Symbols, Computation, and Intentionality","authors":["Steven Horst"],"publishedDate":"2011-09-09","printType":"BOOK","categories":["Philosophy"],"language":"en","thumbnail":"http://books.google.de/books/content?id=3Xi_8t0lqHoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","isbn13":"9780984017638","isbn10":"0984017631"},{"title":"MCSA Windows Server 2012 R2 Administration Study Guide","subtitle":"Exam 70-411","authors":["William Panek"],"publishedDate":"2015-01-20","printType":"BOOK","pageCount":420,"categories":["Computers"],"language":"en","thumbnail":"http://books.google.de/books/content?id=Y_YwBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","isbn13":"9781118916889","isbn10":"1118916883"},{"title":"Buyer’s Guide: Tips for Puchasing a New Computer CourseNotes","authors":["Course Technology"],"publishedDate":"2010-11-12","description":"CourseNotes: Technology in a Flash!

It is generally defined as development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. This definition is based on the ethical imperative of equity within and between generations. Moreover, apart from meeting; \"the basic needs of all\"; sustainable development implies sustaining the natural life support systems on Earth, and extending to all the opportunity to satisfy their aspirations for a better life. Hence, sustainable development is more precisely defined as a process of change in which the exploitation of resources, the direction of investments, the orientation of technological development, and institutional change are all in harmony and enhance both current and future potential to meet human needs and aspiration. To date, various definitions and stationary-state criteria of sustainability have been proposed. Many authors have been concerned with only part of the problem, such as the technological assumptions, the ability to substitute natural resources in economic transformation processes, and the resilience and importance of ecological processes. But, the social dimension did not receive the same attention, and has not been adequately integrated into formal analysis.

Speck","John Ed Greenwood"],"publishedDate":"2009-01","description":"While the grading of student writing is of central concern to composition studies and to teaching, the process has not been clearly defined. The act of assigning a grade raises such issues as how teachers read student writing, whether form and content are of equal concern, what the purpose of grading is, and whether grading should take place at all. The vagueness of grading points to the complexity of the topic, which encompasses such matters as student peer review, psychometrics, student-teacher conferences, portfolios, collaborative learning, and English-as-a-Second-Language. Because of the centrality of grading and its complexity, the topic has generated a large body of literature. This reference book is a helpful guide to the vast and sometimes bewildering body of research on the grading of student writing. The volume includes entries for more than 1300 books and articles on grading published between 1970 and 1996. Each entry includes an annotation that summarizes the work and its importance. The entries are grouped in several broad chapters, with most chapters containing numerous subsections. Thus the book covers such topics as holistic grading, portfolio assessment, collaborative approaches to assessment, essay tests, creative writing, whole language, standardized tests, and student progress. The entries are arranged alphabetically within each subsection, and the author and subject indexes allow the user to access information quickly.","printType":"BOOK","pageCount":340,"categories":["Education"],"language":"en","thumbnail":"http://books.google.de/books/content?id=DstxJSWliDcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","isbn13":"9781593112820","isbn10":"1593112823"},{"title":"Windows Server 2012 R2 Pocket Consultant Volume 1","subtitle":"Essentials & Configuration","authors":["William Stanek"],"publishedDate":"2014-03-15","description":"Portable and precise, this pocket-sized guide delivers ready answers for core configuration and administrative tasks in Windows Server 2012 R2.

The author emphasises the connections with fundamental algorithms from theoretical computer science, particularly the theory of automata and formal languages, computational number theory, and computational commutative algebra. The LLL lattice reduction algorithm and various algorithms for Hermite and Smith normal forms from computational number theory are used to study the abelian quotients of a finitely presented group. The work of Baumslag, Cannonito and Miller on computing nonabelian polycyclic quotients is described as a generalisation of Buchberger's Gröbner basis methods to right ideals in the integral group ring of a polycyclic group.

Under the leadership of Vojin Oklobdzija and a stellar editorial board, some of the industry's foremost experts have joined forces to create what promises to be the definitive resource for computer design and engineering. Instead of focusing on basic, introductory material, it forms a comprehensive, state-of-the-art review of the field's most recent achievements, outstanding issues, and future directions. The world of computer engineering is vast and evolving so rapidly that what is cutting-edge today may be obsolete in a few months.

The cooperation between the two fields was made possible, on the one hand, by the development of information science from a technological discipline to a theoretically founded scientific discipline, and on the other, by the development of psychoanalysis from a hermetically closed special discipline to an open and empirical science. This study reports the successful inclusion of information science as an instrument of research on the psychoanalytic process. This direction of work was initiated by Donald Spence and Hartvig Dahl from the Re search Institute of Mental Health, New York, at the end of the 1960s. H. Thom~, H. K~che1e, and their research group in Ulm must be credited with having adopted Spence's programs as early as 1974; at that time the programs even had to be implemented far away on the IBM computer at the University of Heidelberg. The efforts to expand computer-aided con tent analysis to a method for process research led in 1975 to the ac quisition of the Hamburg program for Electronic Verbal Analysis (EVA). In the following years the author of this study revised, extended, and supplemented the EVA to create the U1m version. This book now describes another step in the integration of information technology in fundamen tal research in psychoanalysis.","printType":"BOOK","pageCount":179,"categories":["Medical"],"language":"en","thumbnail":"http://books.google.de/books/content?id=yJs9BQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","isbn13":"9783662103005","isbn10":"3662103001"},{"title":"Manual for Conducting Socioeconomic Surveys Through Pocket Portable Device Assistants (PDAs) and Personal computers","authors":["Carrión Perea, F.

Requiring no technical or legal expertise, the book explains complicated concepts in clear, straightforward language. The authors—two renowned experts on computer security and law—explore the well-established connection between social norms, privacy, security, and technological structure. This approach is the key to understanding information security and informational privacy, providing a practical framework to address ethical and legal issues. The authors also discuss how rapid technological developments have created novel situations that lack relevant norms and present ways to develop these norms for protecting informational privacy and ensuring sufficient information security. Bridging the gap among computer scientists, economists, lawyers, and public policy makers, this book provides technically and legally sound public policy guidance about online privacy and security. It emphasizes the need to make trade-offs among the complex concerns that arise in the context of online privacy and security.","printType":"BOOK","pageCount":398,"categories":["Computers"],"language":"en","thumbnail":"http://books.google.de/books/content?id=2YsAAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","isbn13":"9781439830130","isbn10":"1439830134"},{"title":"Home Informatics and Telematics","subtitle":"Information, Technology and Society","authors":["Andy Sloane","Felix van Rijn"],"publishedDate":"2013-03-09","description":"This volume is composed of the best papers submitted to the HOIT2000 conference held in Wolverhampton, U.

The conference, entitled \"IT at home: Virtual influences on everyday life\", and the papers reflect the wide variety of these influences that are coming to bear on our everyday experience, be it through the increasing use of computers or the rapid development of new telecommunications systems. The conference has been organised by IFIP Working Group 9. 3 - Home-Oriented Informatics and Telematics (HOIJ) , in association with IFIP Working Group 13. 2- Methodology for user-centred system design. This gives a broad range of topics that are within the sphere of interest of the participants and the authors of the papers. The disciplines involved in the study of this subject area are varied composing computing, telecommunications, psychology, sociology, business studies and others. The conference is the second in a series of HOlT conferences, the first being held in Copenhagen in 1994. The subject is now more mature with the various disciplines being increasingly interested in the home as a research domain. The various technical developments over the time since the first conference have also had a profound effect on the way in which people communicate both in the home and at work.

These brought together mathematicians and physicists working in operational quantum logic and related areas, as well as a number of interested philosophers of science, for a rare opportunity to discuss recent developments in this field. After some discussion, it was decided that, rather than producing a volume of conference proceedings, we would try to organize the conferees to produce a set of comprehensive survey papers, which would not only report on recent developments in quantum logic, but also provide a tutorial overview of the subject suitable for an interested non-specialist audience. The resulting volume provides an overview of the concepts and methods used in current research in quantum logic, viewed both as a branch of mathemati cal physics and as an area of pure mathematics. The first half of the book is concerned with the algebraic side of the subject, and in particular the theory of orthomodular lattices and posets, effect algebras, etc. In the second half of the book, special attention is given to categorical methods and to connections with theoretical computer science. At the 1999 workshop, we were fortunate to hear three excellent lectures by David J. Foulis, represented here by two contributions. Dave's work, spanning 40 years, has helped to define, and continues to reshape, the field of quantum logic.","printType":"BOOK","pageCount":320,"categories":["Mathematics"],"language":"en","thumbnail":"http://books.google.de/books/content?id=KuoN-bu_Zi8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","isbn13":"9780792362586","isbn10":"0792362586"},{"title":"Pioneers of the Computer Age: from Charles Babbage to Steve Jobs","authors":["Abdul Montaqim"],"printType":"BOOK","language":"en","thumbnail":"http://books.google.de/books/content?id=UIWoAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","isbn13":"9781471661969","isbn10":"1471661962"},{"title":"Preattentive Processing of Web Advertising","printType":"BOOK","language":"en","thumbnail":"http://books.google.de/books/content?id=gsyXMt1dPmIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","isbn13":"9781621968450","isbn10":"1621968456"},{"title":"The Trouble with Computers","subtitle":"Usefulness, Usability, and Productivity","authors":["Thomas K.

Its originality resides mainly in its treating at the same time foundations of classical and foundations of constructive mathematics. This confrontation of two kinds of foundations contributes to answering questions such as: Are foundations/foundational theories of classical mathematics of a different nature compared to those of constructive mathematics? Do they play the same role for the resp. mathematics? Are there connections between the two kinds of foundational theories? etc. The confrontation and comparison is often implicit and sometimes explicit. Its great advantage is to extend the traditional discussion of the foundations of mathematics and to render it at the same time more subtle and more differentiated. Another important aspect of the book is that some of its contributions are of a more philosophical, others of a more technical nature. This double face is emphasized, since foundations of mathematics is an eminent topic in the philosophy of mathematics: hence both sides of this discipline ought to be and are being paid due to.","printType":"BOOK","pageCount":316,"categories":["Mathematics"],"language":"en","thumbnail":"http://books.google.de/books/content?id=wmJCf3d8HBUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","isbn13":"9789400704312","isbn10":"9400704313"},{"title":"Medieval Studies and the Computer","subtitle":"Computers and The Humanities","authors":["Anne Gilmour-Bryson"],"publishedDate":"2014-05-19","description":"Medieval Studies and the Computer focuses on the use of computers in medieval studies and humanities research.

A computer analysis of metrical patterns in the epic Beowulf and of Notker Labeo's Old High German is also presented. Comprised of 26 chapters, this volume begins by discussing \"contexts\" in concordances and the set of conventions employed in text encoding. The reader is then introduced to the series of initiatives undertaken in Belgium to study Latin literature and linguistics; the use of conceptual glossaries by medieval scholars; and the use of the computer to make a word list of the Decretum Gratiani and to study Geoffrey Chaucer's vocabulary. Subsequent chapters discuss a computer program called KLIC (Key Letter In Context) for graphological analysis; a set of routines written in SAIL (Stanford Artificial Intelligence Language) for use by social historians in quantitative analysis or text processing; and the use of Mark IV, a general-purpose file management system, to analyze medieval charters.

Hart"],"publishedDate":"2004-02-05","description":"In the late 1980s and 1990s, the advanced industrial countries considered replacing the existing analogue television infrastructure with a new digital one. A key common feature to the debates over digital TV (DTV) in the United States, Western Europe and Japan was the eventual victory of the ideas of digitalism (the superiority of everything digital over everything analogue) and of digital convergence (the merging of computing, telecommunications and broadcasting infrastructures made possible by digitalization) in public debates over standards. Jeffrey Hart's book shows how nationalism and regionalism combined with digitalism to produce three different and incompatible DTV standards in the three regions, an outcome which has led to missed opportunities in developing the new technologies. Hart's book contributes to our understanding of relations between business and government, and of competition between the world's great economic powers.","printType":"BOOK","categories":["Political Science"],"language":"en","thumbnail":"http://books.google.de/books/content?id=R4j_Pmj_l9MC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","isbn13":"9781139442244","isbn10":"1139442244"},{"title":"Cybercrime","subtitle":"A Reference Handbook","authors":["Bernadette Hlubik Schell","Clemens Martin"],"publishedDate":"2004-01-01","description":"Cybercrime: A Reference Handbook documents the history of computer hacking from free long distance phone calls to virtual espionage to worries of a supposed \"cyber apocalypse,\" and provides accessible information everyone should know.","printType":"BOOK","pageCount":247,"categories":["Computers"],"language":"en","thumbnail":"http://books.google.de/books/content?id=AUUERdg6b94C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","isbn13":"9781851096831","isbn10":"1851096833"},{"title":"Categories for the working mathematician","authors":["Saunders Mac Lane"],"publishedDate":"1971","printType":"BOOK","language":"en","isbn13":"","isbn10":""}],[{"title":"Cognition and Multi-Agent Interaction","subtitle":"From Cognitive Modeling to Social Simulation","authors":["Ron Sun"],"publishedDate":"2006","description":"Explores the intersection between individual cognitive modeling and modeling of multi-agent interaction.","printType":"BOOK","pageCount":434,"categories":["Computers"],"language":"en","thumbnail":"http://books.google.de/books/content?id=V1RyhTamPkgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","isbn13":"9780521839648","isbn10":"0521839645"},{"title":"Fundamentals of Reliability Engineering","subtitle":"Applications in Multistage Interconnection Networks","authors":["Indra Gunawan"],"publishedDate":"2014-03-10","printType":"BOOK","pageCount":184,"categories":["Computers"],"language":"en","thumbnail":"http://books.google.de/books/content?id=NR0RAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","isbn13":"9781118914380","isbn10":"1118914384"},{"title":"Practical Reliability Of Electronic Equipment And Products","authors":["Eugene R.

The subject matter covered is the collection of techniques that are used to achieve the highest performance in single-processor machines; these techniques center the exploitation of low-level parallelism (temporal and spatial) in the processing of machine instructions. The target audience consists students in the final year of an undergraduate program or in the first year of a postgraduate program in computer science, computer engineering, or electrical engineering; professional computer designers will also also find the book useful as an introduction to the topics covered. Typically, the author has used the material presented here as the basis of a full-semester undergraduate course or a half-semester post graduate course, with the other half of the latter devoted to multiple-processor machines. The background assumed of the reader is a good first course in computer architecture and implementation - to the level in, say, Computer Organization and Design, by D. Patterson and H. Hennessy - and familiarity with digital-logic design. The book consists of eight chapters: The first chapter is an introduction to all of the main ideas that the following chapters cover in detail: the topics covered are the main forms of pipelining used in high-performance uniprocessors, a taxonomy of the space of pipelined processors, and performance issues.

We organize these techniques according to the assumptions they make about the generation of instances. Our first assumption is that the instances are generated by a fixed distribution. Many algorithms are designed to perform well when instances are generated by an adversary; we give two techniques to modify these algorithms to improve performance when the instances are instead generated by a distribution. We validate these techniques with extensive experiments using a wide range of real world data sets. Our second assumption is that the target concept the algorithm is attempting to learn changes over time. We give a modification of the Winnow algorithm and show it has good bounds for tracking a shifting concept when instances are generated by an adversary. We also consider the case that the instances are generated by a shifting distribution. We apply variations of the previous fixed distribution techniques and show, with real data derived experiments, that these techniques continue to significantly improve performance. Last, we assume that the labels for instances may be delayed for a number of trials. We give techniques to modify an on-line algorithm so that it has good performance even when the labels are delayed. We derive upper-bounds on the performance of these modifications and show through lower-bounds that these modifications are close to optimal.","printType":"BOOK","pageCount":307,"language":"en","thumbnail":"http://books.google.de/books/content?id=DHr6JJBfkXoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","isbn13":"9780549699743","isbn10":"0549699740"},{"title":"Proceedings of the 12th European Conference on Research Methods","subtitle":"ECRM 2013","authors":["Isabel Ramos","Anabela Mesquita"],"publishedDate":"2013-04-07","description":"Complete proceedings of the 13th European Conference on Research Methodology for Business and Management Studies ECRM 2013 PRINT version Published by Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited.","printType":"BOOK","categories":["Business"],"language":"en","thumbnail":"http://books.google.de/books/content?id=hbYVBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","isbn13":"9781909507302","isbn10":"190950730X"},{"title":"Global Economic Competition","subtitle":"Today's Warfare in Global Electronics Industries and Companies","authors":["George Kozmetsky","Piyu Yue"],"publishedDate":"1997-01-31","description":"Global competitiveness has always been a hotly debated issue, promoting differing opinions among economists, management strategists, business leaders, and policy analysts and consultants. Global Economic Competition provides a broad framework to compare the United States economy with 23 other global economies. This is done by presenting empirical evidence in a series of comparative analyses of economic competition using data pertaining to specific countries, industries and companies. In this volume, the electronics industries are used to illustrate an ongoing economic warfare among competing regions, nations, and cluster companies across the electronic technology chain. Employing the latest empirical data to evaluate the competitiveness of the US economy and its electronic industries and companies in the 1980s and early 1990s, Global Economic Competition will be of interest not only to those who study economics, management science and international trade, but also to policy makers and business leaders.","printType":"BOOK","pageCount":426,"categories":["Business & Economics"],"language":"en","thumbnail":"http://books.google.de/books/content?id=Jw73RWyv160C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","isbn13":"9780792398547","isbn10":"0792398548"},{"title":"Financial Accounting: For Chaudhary Charan Singh University","authors":["V.

This, at best, causes undue stress on the student as they feel unprepared when faced with unfamiliar material, and at worst, results in students dropping out of the program or changing majors when they discover that their chosen field of engineering is not what they thought it was. The purpose of this text is to introduce the student to a general cross-section of the field of electrical and computer engineering. The text is aimed at incoming freshmen, and as such, assumes that the reader has a limited to nonexistent background in electrical engineering and knowledge of no more than pre-calculus in the field of mathematics. By exposing students to these fields at an introductory level, early in their studies, they will have both a better idea of what to expect in later classes and a good foundation of knowledge upon which to build.","printType":"BOOK","pageCount":736,"categories":["Computers"],"language":"en","thumbnail":"http://books.google.de/books/content?id=9nqkVbFPutYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","isbn13":"9781581129717","isbn10":"1581129718"},{"title":"Managing Indian Brands, 2E","authors":["S Ramesh Kumar"],"publishedDate":"2009-11-01","printType":"BOOK","pageCount":487,"language":"en","thumbnail":"http://books.google.de/books/content?id=T68Fh9AZkvcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","isbn13":"9788125913085","isbn10":"8125913084"},{"title":"Social Administration","authors":["Roger A.

The range of hardware configurations and supporting software on offer to the potential user is bewildering. This extends from the inexpensive single-user micro-based system, through to the vast industrial networks which are supported by many remote mainframe machines and have been reported to service up to a thousand workstations. This advance in technology has been driven by, and in its turn has fuelled, the development of ever greater computing power and graphics capability. It is these features that all working in the field would now recognize as essential to any CADCAM system. Effort has thus been put into developing a range of structural and solid modellers which, in conjunction with the appropriate terminal configuration and ray tracing graphics technology, can construct pictures of uncanny realism. Complicated analysis programs have been developed that can calculate the stresses in complex structures and display the results as colour shaded maps upon the surface of a pictorial view of the object. If the time to process and the system cost are ignored, then the apparent ease with which these systems perform such analysis and generate such high quality images, leaves the observer awe struck.","printType":"BOOK","pageCount":232,"categories":["Science"],"language":"en","thumbnail":"http://books.google.de/books/content?id=IXIeBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","isbn13":"9781461598640","isbn10":"1461598648"},{"title":"Cliffsnotes GED Test Cram Plan","authors":["Murray Shukyn","Achim K.

Stroope"],"publishedDate":"2008","description":"The rapid growth of the internet over the last ten years has led many people to question the social implications of this new technology. Using nationally representative data collected by the Pew Internet & American Life Project in October and November of 2004, I investigated how gender influences the ways American teenagers use the internet. I used quantitative analysis to document the scope of the gender gap and identify the individual-level social factors that perpetuate the gender gap. I focused on five different areas of internet use, and found that, overall, gender matters. First, my analysis focused on the frequency and intensity of girls' and boys' internet use. Results suggest that girls are more likely to go online than boys, although I found no difference between teens' intensity of internet use. Second, my analysis focused on the types of skills teens use on the internet and found that girls are more likely to use the internet for communicating with others while boys are more likely to use the internet in ways that demand some advanced skills. Third, I focused on the technical means of access through which teens go online, but I found no differences between girls and boys. Fourth, I analyzed teens' autonomy of use of the internet and found that parents are more likely to monitor boy's internet use than girl's use. Lastly, I looked at social support networks of teens who go online and found that girls are more likely than boys to have friends who go online. Overall, my study contributes to the sociological body of knowledge in three important ways. First, it extends the debate about the digital divide by refining our understanding of digital inequalities beyond simple access. Second, it investigates a social group, teens, that has been overlooked by social scientists studying new media and the internet. Third, and most importantly, it extends our understanding of the social organization of internet use in terms of gender.","printType":"BOOK","pageCount":171,"language":"en","thumbnail":"http://books.google.de/books/content?id=_ow4KNRSDqwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","isbn13":"9780549582816","isbn10":"0549582819"},{"title":"The Rubato Composer Music Software","subtitle":"Component-Based Implementation of a Functorial Concept Architecture","authors":["Gérard Milmeister"],"publishedDate":"2009-04-05","description":"Both modern mathematical music theory and computer science are strongly influenced by the theory of categories and functors. One outcome of this research is the data format of denotators, which is based on set-valued presheaves over the category of modules and diaffine homomorphisms. The functorial approach of denotators deals with generalized points in the form of arrows and allows the construction of a universal concept architecture. This architecture is ideal for handling all aspects of music, especially for the analysis and composition of highly abstract musical works. This book presents an introduction to the theory of module categories and the theory of denotators, as well as the design of a software system, called Rubato Composer, which is an implementation of the category-theoretic concept framework. The application is written in portable Java and relies on plug-in components, so-called rubettes, which may be combined in data flow networks for the generation and manipulation of denotators. The Rubato Composer system is open to arbitrary extension and is freely available under the GPL license. It allows the developer to build specialized rubettes for tasks that are of interest to composers, who in turn combine them to create music. It equally serves music theorists, who use them to extract information from and manipulate musical structures. They may even develop new theories by experimenting with the many parameters that are at their disposal thanks to the increased flexibility of the functorial concept architecture. Two contributed chapters by Guerino Mazzola and Florian Thalmann illustrate the application of the theory as well as the software in the development of compositional tools and the creation of a musical work with the help of the Rubato framework.","printType":"BOOK","pageCount":301,"categories":["Computers"],"language":"en","thumbnail":"http://books.google.de/books/content?id=HH4mVt--UsYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","isbn13":"9783642001482","isbn10":"3642001483"},{"title":"The Effective Public Manager","subtitle":"Achieving Success in Government Organizations","authors":["Steven Cohen","William Eimicke","Tanya Heikkila"],"publishedDate":"2013-08-06","printType":"BOOK","pageCount":352,"categories":["Business & Economics"],"language":"en","thumbnail":"http://books.google.de/books/content?id=OelvAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","isbn13":"9781118573297","isbn10":"1118573293"},{"title":"Encyclopedia of Microcomputers","subtitle":"Volume 13 - Optical Disks to Production Scheduling","authors":["Allen Kent","James G.

Throughout the author’s teaching experiences, Dr Lai has identified several problems that occur in a high frequency for both the beginner as well as advanced translators. The ultimate aim of this book is to derive a translation principle that is able to solve a divergent range of translation problems, subsequently leading to the enhancement of translation quality and to show translators how to deal with these problems. Key Features Is the first book that introduces the translation of economic editorials. This book is interdisciplinary in its nature as it cuts across four fields: economics, law, translation theory and transformational grammar (linguistics). The book bridges the gap between translation theory and real world translation problems. The application of this book is not restricted to economic editorials. The principle of proportionality can be applicable to other types of editorials, including economics, foreign policy, politics, bioethics, and popular science. The Author Dr Ping-Yen Lai is Chairperson, Associate Professor, Department of Translation and Interpretation, National Changhua University of Education, Taiwan. The author has an MBA from the University of Iowa, a JD from the Chinese University of Hong Kong and a PhD - State University of New York at Buffalo. M.S., Applied Statistics, Michigan State University, 1991. Dr Lai is the author of many journal and paper articles.

In recent years, however, the emergence of digital scholarship has revolutionized -- and complicated -- the picture in unexpected ways as new electronic media have enabled academics to communicate scholarly material in innovative formats such as websites, PowerPoint presentations, CD-ROMs, and virtual reality tours. Despite this growing output of sophisticated digital scholarship, there has been little attempt to set standards, define basic issues and concepts, or integrate electronic scholarship into the tenure debate. This collection of cutting-edge articles marks the first effort to evaluate the place of digital scholarship in the tenure, promotion, and review process. As a primer aimed at scholars, faculty members, and department chairs in the humanities, social sciences, and other fields, as well as deans, provosts, and university administrators, this collection examines the evolution of nontraditional scholarship, analyzes the various formats, and suggests guidelines for assessment on a scholarly level. It also examines the impact of digital scholarship in the classroom and academy and explores new directions for the future. This book will help shape policy in the murky world of tenure review and become a point of reference for scholars and administrators everywhere.","printType":"BOOK","categories":["Education"],"language":"en","thumbnail":"http://books.google.de/books/content?id=9cpB1BICwIIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","isbn13":"9780765631534","isbn10":"0765631539"},{"title":"The Machine in Me","subtitle":"An Anthropologist Sits Among Computer Engineers","authors":["Gary Lee Downey"],"publishedDate":"2014-03-05","description":"First Published in 1998.

However, security concerns are frequently raised in circumstances where interconnected computers use a network not controlled by any one entity or organization. Introduction to Network Security examines various network protocols, focusing on vulnerabilities, exploits, attacks, and methods to mitigate an attack. The book begins with a brief discussion of network architectures and the functions of layers in a typical network. It then examines vulnerabilities and attacks divided into four categories: header-, protocol-, authentication-, and traffic-based. The author next explores the physical, network, and transport layers of each network as well as the security of several common network applications. The last section recommends several network-based security solutions that can be successfully deployed. This book uses a define-attack-defend methodology for network security. The author briefly introduces the relevant protocols and follows up with detailed descriptions of known vulnerabilities and possible attack methods. He delineates the threats against the protocol and presents possible solutions. Sample problems and lab experiments based on the concepts allow readers to experiment with attacks and assess the effectiveness of solutions. Two appendices provide further clarification and a companion website is offered which supplements the material. While most of the books available on this subject focus solely on cryptographic techniques to mitigate attacks, this volume recognizes the limitations of this methodology and considers a wider range of security problems and solutions. By focusing on a practical view of network security and examining actual protocols, readers can better understand the vulnerabilities and develop appropriate countermeasures.","printType":"BOOK","pageCount":504,"categories":["Computers"],"language":"en","thumbnail":"http://books.google.de/books/content?id=50DMBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","isbn13":"9781420010695","isbn10":"1420010697"}],[{"title":"Categorical Methods in Computer Science","subtitle":"With Aspects from Topology","authors":["Hartmut Ehrig","Horst Herrlich","Hans-Jörg Kreowski"],"publishedDate":"1989-10-11","description":"This volume contains selected papers of the International Workshop on \"Categorical Methods in Computer Science - with Aspects from Topology\" and of the \"6th International Data Type Workshop\" held in August/September 1988 in Berlin.

Researchers have begun to study changing workplace skill demands. Some economists have found that technological change is \"skill-biased,\" increasing demand for highly skilled workers and contributing to the growing gap in wages between college-educated workers and those with less education. However, other studies of workplace skill demands have reached different conclusions. These differences result partly from differences in disciplinary perspective, research methods, and datasets. The findings of all of these strands of research on changing skill demands are limited by available methods and data sources. Because case study research focuses on individual work sites or occupations, its results may not be representative of larger industry or national trends. At a more basic level, there is some disagreement in the literature about how to define \"skill\". In part because of such disagreements, researchers have used a variety of measures of skill, making it difficult to compare findings from different studies or to accumulate knowledge of skill trends over time. In the context of this increasing discussion, the National Research Council held a workshop to explore the available research evidence related to two important guiding questions: What are the strengths and weaknesses of different research methods and data sources for providing insights about current and future changes in skill demands? What support does the available evidence (given the strengths and weaknesses of the methods and data sources) provide for the proposition that the skills required for the 21st century workplace will be meaningfully different from earlier eras and will require corresponding changes in educational preparation?","printType":"BOOK","pageCount":126,"categories":["Social Science"],"language":"en","thumbnail":"http://books.google.de/books/content?id=8iWxflEKbYUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","isbn13":"9780309185790","isbn10":"0309185793"},{"title":"Memory for Survival Processing of Hierarchical Categories","authors":["David A.

Kruse II","Jay G. Heiser"],"publishedDate":"2001-09-26","description":"Every computer crime leaves tracks–you just have to know where to find them. This book shows you how to collect and analyze the digital evidence left behind in a digital crime scene. Computers have always been susceptible to unwanted intrusions, but as the sophistication of computer technology increases so does the need to anticipate, and safeguard against, a corresponding rise in computer-related criminal activity. Computer forensics, the newest branch of computer security, focuses on the aftermath of a computer security incident. The goal of computer forensics is to conduct a structured investigation to determine exactly what happened, who was responsible, and to perform the investigation in such a way that the results are useful in a criminal proceeding. Written by two experts in digital investigation, Computer Forensics provides extensive information on how to handle the computer as evidence. Kruse and Heiser walk the reader through the complete forensics process–from the initial collection of evidence through the final report. Topics include an overview of the forensic relevance of encryption, the examination of digital evidence for clues, and the most effective way to present your evidence and conclusions in court. Unique forensic issues associated with both the Unix and the Windows NT/2000 operating systems are thoroughly covered. This book provides a detailed methodology for collecting, preserving, and effectively using evidence by addressing the three A's of computer forensics: Acquire the evidence without altering or damaging the original data. Authenticate that your recorded evidence is the same as the original seized data. Analyze the data without modifying the recovered data. Computer Forensics is written for everyone who is responsible for investigating digital criminal incidents or who may be interested in the techniques that such investigators use. It is equally helpful to those investigating hacked web servers, and those who are investigating the source of illegal pornography.","printType":"BOOK","pageCount":416,"categories":["Computers"],"language":"en","thumbnail":"http://books.google.de/books/content?id=-qWa5Svv7BIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","isbn13":"9780672334085","isbn10":"0672334089"},{"title":"Getting Started in Genealogy Online","authors":["William Dollarhide"],"publishedDate":"2006","description":"Genealogy expert Dollarhide updates his previous Genealogy Starter Kit with this treatment based upon Internet resources.

While keeping with the practice of covering the wide range of food processing techniques, this new edition has been substantially expanded to take account of the advances in technology that have taken place since the publication of the first edition. The Second Edition includes new chapters on computer control of processing, novel 'minimal' technologies, and Ohmic heating, and an extended chapter on modified atmosphere packaging. It is a comprehensive - yet basic - text that offers an overview of most unit operations, while at the same time providing details of the processing equipment, operating conditions and the effects of processing on the biochemistry of foods. The book is divided into five parts, in which unit operations are grouped according to the nature of the heat transfer that takes place. Each chapter describes the formulae required for calculation of processing parameters, sample problems, and the effects on sensory characteristics and nutritional properties of selected foods.

This book claimed that through a piece of software called a \"browser\", which accesses \"web sites\", the world economy and our daily lives would change forever. Would you have believed even 10 percent of that book? Did you take advantage of the first Internet wave and get ahead of the curve? Pull is the blueprint to the next disruptive wave. Some call it Web 3.0; others call it the semantic web. It's a fundamental transition from pushing information to pulling, using a new way of thinking and collaborating online. Using the principles of this book, you will slash 5-20 percent off your bottom line, make your customers happier, accelerate your industry, and prepare your company for the twenty-first century. It isn't going to be easy, and you don't have any choice. By 2015, your company will be more agile and your processes more flexible than you ever thought possible. The semantic web leads to possibilities straight from science fiction, such as buildings that can order their own supplies, eliminating the IRS, and lawyers finally making sense. But it also leads to major changes in every field, from shipping and retail distribution to health care and financial reporting. Through clear examples, case studies, principles, and scenarios, business strategist David Siegel takes you on a tour of this new world. You'll learn: -Which industries are already ahead. -Which industries are already dead. -How to make the power shift from pushing to pulling information. -How software, hardware, media, and marketing will all change. -How to plan your own strategy for embracing the semantic web. We are at the beginning of a new technology curve that will affect all areas of business. Right now, you have a choice. You can decide to start preparing for the exciting opportunities that lay ahead or you can leave this book on the shelf and get left in the dust like last time.","printType":"BOOK","pageCount":288,"categories":["Computers"],"language":"en","thumbnail":"http://books.google.de/books/content?id=nw49NFNSQCEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","isbn13":"9781101163030","isbn10":"1101163038"},{"title":"The Cambridge Handbook of Cognitive Science","authors":["Keith Frankish","William Ramsey"],"publishedDate":"2012-07-19","description":"An authoritative, up-to-date survey of the state of the art in cognitive science, written for non-specialists.","printType":"BOOK","pageCount":333,"categories":["Philosophy"],"language":"en","thumbnail":"http://books.google.de/books/content?id=JjEzjrZ6ZG4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","isbn13":"9780521691901","isbn10":"0521691907"},{"title":"Computer Attitudes, Self-efficacy, and Usage of Children and Their Parents: Viewed Through the Gender Lens","authors":["Luba Zuk Levy"],"publishedDate":"2008","description":"I This research concurrently examined the computer attitudes, self-efficacy, and usage of parents and of their children ages 10--14 years residing in the Tarrant County area.

It brings forward many of the hidden complexities of the human-dimensions of HCI, and owes to the educative nature of the techno-saga. The first three chapters are designed to set the background for the duality of the human/machine dimensions of HCI. Chapter four leaves the machine-side of the techno-saga to re-enter the usability context. Consequently, in this chapter people’s techno-interactions are combined with the machine-side of the HCI equation to evaluate effective solutions that try to achieve techno-satisfying outcomes. While it still maintains the human side, chapter five covers cognitive performance. Chapter six becomes quite demonstrative, drawing away from the more usual linguistics to speak to the reader through a series of metaphorical human-dimensioned HCI models. Chapter seven brings the reader back to earth to concentrate again on the human-side of the HCI equation; this time to speak about expectations that people have in seeking techno-solutions to everyday issues. Chapter eight returns the focus to the machine-side; emphasizing that a balanced approach is necessary for achieving effective HCI, as this book would not be complete without a section for dealing with gender and how it relates, if at all, to HCI.","printType":"BOOK","pageCount":280,"categories":["Computers"],"language":"en","thumbnail":"http://books.google.de/books/content?id=pQ3vAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","isbn13":"9781607503378","isbn10":"1607503379"},{"title":"Computer Networks - Ii","authors":["I.A.Dhotre V.S.Bagad"],"publishedDate":"2005-01-01","description":"The Application LayerDNS - The domain name system : The DNS name space, Resource records, Name servers; Electronic mail : Architecture and services, The user agent, Message formats, Message transfer, Final delivery; The world wide web: Architectural overview, Static web documents, Dynamic web documents, HTTP, Performance enhancements, The wireless web.Multimedia NetworkingMultimedia networking applications, Streaming stored audio & video, Making the best of the best-effort service : An Internet example ; Protocols for real time interactive applications : RTP, RTP control protocol, SIP, H.323; Beyond best effort : Different scenarios; Scheduling and Policing mechanisms; Integrated services; RSVP; Differentiated services; Internet Radio, Voice over IP, Multimedia file formats, Audio and Video compression, Video on demand.Security in Computer NetworksNetwork security, Principles of cryptography; Authentication protocols; Integrity; Key distribution and Certification; Access control; Fire walls, Attacks and countermeasures; Security in many layers : Case studies; Web security; Social issues.Network ManagementInfrastructure of network management; The Internet standard management frame work, Structure of management information (SMI), Management information base (MIB), SNMP protocol operations and Transport mappings, security and Administration.","printType":"BOOK","pageCount":156,"language":"en","thumbnail":"http://books.google.de/books/content?id=Km3V7ZDSD60C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","isbn13":"9788189411404","isbn10":"8189411403"},{"title":"Applying Manufacturing Execution Systems","authors":["Michael McClellan"],"publishedDate":"1997-08-21","description":"Computer systems have become an integral part of most companies.

It represents an attempt to conceptualize an alternative model of mobile computer usability. It is motivated by the author’s conviction that we do not yet have an adequate understanding of this concept because we have not taken seriously the transformation of human personality by the co-evolution of organization and ICTs. The author argues that the transformation has resulted in a human personality whose personal and organizational activities are characterized by strong continuities between them. This characterization reflects a new kind of personality of the worker, and is a critical determinant of mobile computer usability. The word ‘organizational’ is used to describe this kind of personality – hence an alternative organizational personality perspective on mobile computer usability. This perspective suggests that a mobile computer is more usable to a person than another one because of its satisfaction of both his personal and organizational motives, which are in turn shaped by the co-evolution of organization, technology and personality.","printType":"BOOK","pageCount":211,"categories":["Business & Economics"],"language":"en","thumbnail":"http://books.google.de/books/content?id=hHPABAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","isbn13":"9783642410741","isbn10":"364241074X"}],[{"title":"A Spatial Analysis System for Environmental Health Surveillance","authors":["Chetan Tiwari"],"publishedDate":"2008","description":"On the second requirement, I develop a web-based analysis system that combines developments in Web-GIS technologies and computer science with disease mapping and spatial analysis methods to create an environmental health surveillance system where users, who may not be experts in GIS or spatial analysis, can quickly create maps of disease burdens.

Now we see in the past quarter-century how the philosophy of science has been profoundly in fluenced by historical studies of the sciences, and no longer concerned so single-mindedly with the analysis of theory and explanation, with the re lation between hypotheses and experimental observation. Now also we see the traditional historical studies of technology supplemented by phi losophical questions, and no longer so plainly focussed upon contexts of application, on invention and practical engineering, and on the mutually stimulating relations between technology and society. Further, alas, the neat division of intellectual labor, those clearly drawn distinctions be tween science and technology, between the theoretical and the applied, between discovery and justification, between internalist and externalist approaches . . . all, all have become muddled! Partly, this is due to internal revolutions within the philosophy and his tory of science (the first result being recognition of their mutual rele vance). Partly, however, this state of 'muddle' is due to external factors: science, at the least in the last half-century, has become so intimately connected with technology, and technological developments have cre ated so many new fields of scientific (and philosophical) inquiry that any critical reflection on scientific and technological endeavors must hence forth take their interaction into account.","printType":"BOOK","pageCount":384,"categories":["Science"],"language":"en","thumbnail":"http://books.google.de/books/content?id=armLBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","isbn13":"9789400945128","isbn10":"9400945124"},{"title":"Rowan University 2012","authors":["Scott Wordsman"],"publishedDate":"2011-03-15","printType":"BOOK","categories":["Reference"],"language":"en","thumbnail":"http://books.google.de/books/content?id=BEXgFCLVYPsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","isbn13":"9781427497772","isbn10":"142749777X"},{"title":"The Routledge Handbook of Emotions and Mass Media","authors":["Katrin Doveling","Christian von Scheve","Elly A.

Now we see in the past quarter-century how the philosophy of science has been profoundly in fluenced by historical studies of the sciences, and no longer concerned so single-mindedly with the analysis of theory and explanation, with the re lation between hypotheses and experimental observation. Now also we see the traditional historical studies of technology supplemented by phi losophical questions, and no longer so plainly focussed upon contexts of application, on invention and practical engineering, and on the mutually stimulating relations between technology and society. Further, alas, the neat division of intellectual labor, those clearly drawn distinctions be tween science and technology, between the theoretical and the applied, between discovery and justification, between internalist and externalist approaches . . . all, all have become muddled! Partly, this is due to internal revolutions within the philosophy and his tory of science (the first result being recognition of their mutual rele vance). Partly, however, this state of 'muddle' is due to external factors: science, at the least in the last half-century, has become so intimately connected with technology, and technological developments have cre ated so many new fields of scientific (and philosophical) inquiry that any critical reflection on scientific and technological endeavors must hence forth take their interaction into account.","printType":"BOOK","pageCount":384,"categories":["Science"],"language":"en","thumbnail":"http://books.google.de/books/content?id=armLBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","isbn13":"9789400945128","isbn10":"9400945124"},{"title":"Rowan University 2012","authors":["Scott Wordsman"],"publishedDate":"2011-03-15","printType":"BOOK","categories":["Reference"],"language":"en","thumbnail":"http://books.google.de/books/content?id=BEXgFCLVYPsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","isbn13":"9781427497772","isbn10":"142749777X"},{"title":"Multimedia for Cultural Heritage","subtitle":"First International Workshop, MM4CH 2011, Modena, Italy, May 3, 2011, Revised Selected Papers","authors":["Costantino Grana","Rita Cucchiara"],"publishedDate":"2012-01-24","description":"This book constitutes the revised selected papers from the First International Workshop on Multimedia for Cultural Heritage, MM4CH 2011, held in Modena, Italy, on May 3, 2011.

In this traditional model, cognition mediates between perception and plans of action. Realizing that this core AI, as it was known, was illusory, Rodney A. Brooks turned the field of AI on its head by introducing the behavior-based approach to robotics. The cornerstone of behavior-based robotics is the realization that the coupling of perception and action gives rise to all the power of intelligence and that cognition is only in the eye of an observer. Behavior-based robotics has been the basis of successful applications in entertainment, service industries, agriculture, mining, and the home. It has given rise to both autonomous mobile robots and more recent humanoid robots such as Brooks' Cog. This book represents Brooks' initial formulation of and contributions to the development of the behavior-based approach to robotics. It presents all of the key philosophical and technical ideas that put this \"bottom-up\" approach at the forefront of current research in not only AI but all of cognitive science.","printType":"BOOK","pageCount":199,"categories":["Computers"],"language":"en","thumbnail":"http://books.google.de/books/content?id=btvRZ5rj51EC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","isbn13":"9780262522632","isbn10":"0262522632"},{"title":"The Routledge Handbook of Emotions and Mass Media","authors":["Katrin Doveling","Christian von Scheve","Elly A.

With the early November announcement that GM and Ford were forming online marketplaces for their suppliers, they placed themselves at the center of new e-business ecosystems that will transform their entire way of doing business.

New grounds have been broken in architectures, design techniques, run-time - con?guration, and applications of ?eld programmable devices in several di?erent areas. Many of these innovations are reported in this volume. The size of FPL conferences has grown signi?cantly over the years. FPL in 2002 saw 214 papers submitted, representing an increase of 83% when compared to the year before. The interest and support for FPL in the programmable logic community continued this year with 216 papers submitted. The technical p- gram was assembled from 90 selected regular papers and 56 posters, resulting in this volume of proceedings. The program also included three invited plenary keynote presentations from LSI Logic, Xilinx and Cadence, and three industrial tutorials from Altera, Mentor Graphics and Daf","printType":"BOOK","pageCount":1179,"categories":["Computers"],"language":"en","thumbnail":"http://books.google.de/books/content?id=802Ij7r6QREC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","isbn13":"9783540408222","isbn10":"3540408223"},{"title":"Introduction to Maple","authors":["Andre HECK"],"publishedDate":"2003-04-08","description":"A \"gentle\" introduction to Maple--updated to incorporate the latest version of the software.

Spivak"],"publishedDate":"2014-10-10","description":"Category theory was invented in the 1940s to unify and synthesize different areas in mathematics, and it has proven remarkably successful in enabling powerful communication between disparate fields and subfields within mathematics. This book shows that category theory can be useful outside of mathematics as a rigorous, flexible, and coherent modeling language throughout the sciences. Information is inherently dynamic; the same ideas can be organized and reorganized in countless ways, and the ability to translate between such organizational structures is becoming increasingly important in the sciences. Category theory offers a unifying framework for information modeling that can facilitate the translation of knowledge between disciplines. Written in an engaging and straightforward style, and assuming little background in mathematics, the book is rigorous but accessible to non-mathematicians. Using databases as an entry to category theory, it begins with sets and functions, then introduces the reader to notions that are fundamental in mathematics: monoids, groups, orders, and graphs -- categories in disguise. After explaining the \"big three\" concepts of category theory -- categories, functors, and natural transformations -- the book covers other topics, including limits, colimits, functor categories, sheaves, monads, and operads. The book explains category theory by examples and exercises rather than focusing on theorems and proofs. It includes more than 300 exercises, with selected solutions. Category Theory for the Sciences is intended to create a bridge between the vast array of mathematical concepts used by mathematicians and the models and frameworks of such scientific disciplines as computation, neuroscience, and physics.","printType":"BOOK","pageCount":496,"categories":["Computers"],"language":"en","thumbnail":"http://books.google.de/books/content?id=CwfjBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","isbn13":"9780262028134","isbn10":"0262028131"}],[{"title":"Java Web Development Illuminated","authors":["Kai Qian"],"publishedDate":"2007","description":"This text introduces students to the concepts of building Web-distributed applications and helps develop the necessary skills through numerous examples, projects, case studies and hands-on examples.","printType":"BOOK","pageCount":702,"categories":["Computers"],"language":"en","thumbnail":"http://books.google.de/books/content?id=oY9fShrQyUgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","isbn13":"9780763734237","isbn10":"0763734233"},{"title":"7 Days to Minimalist Living","subtitle":"A Stress-Free Guide to Declutter, Clean & Organize Your Home & Your Life","authors":["Elizabeth N.

Clutter can: • Overwhelm the senses • Consume space • Drain energy from our surroundings • Cause stress and anxiety This book will show you how to lighten up so you can walk into your home and be surrounded only by the things you love. Living in a minimalistic way means clearing the clutter from your life to focus on what’s truly important. Chances are, 75% of the things in your home are no benefit to your life at all. You’ll also find that throwing out a few garbage bags feels even better than therapy. Why do you hold onto things? Here are just some of the reasons: • Security—but the paradox is that the more we cling, the more frustrated and overwhelmed we feel. • Addiction—shopping is a high and the novelty wears off. • Approval—keeping material representations of who we are is one way we show off. • Identity—we identify with what we own so that’s why we’re upset when something is stolen or broken. • Obligation to others—we please others by keeping gifts and inherited things we don’t really like or need. By letting go of possessions that no longer serves us, we can • Let go of old beliefs • Open ourselves up to new opportunities and relationships • See your home, your life for what they really are • Need less and do more • Cultivate meaningful relationships • Be more in tune with yourself in a meditative space • Stop shopping as a form of therapy • Stop wasting money • Restore clarity • FIND WHAT YOU REALLY VALUE When you have inner clutter, it expands to your environment. So when you live in a clean and soothing environment, it can only benefit your inner life. Don’t let the word minimalism scare you. Minimalistic living is not about getting rid of modern advancements and living in the stone age. It’s only about keeping things that are useful, meaningful and add value to your life. While it does not place importance on material things and lavish living, minimalism is also not about denying yourself of the things you need. The guide is divided by different rooms and topics to make it easy and practical to refer to. • Entryway • Kitchen • Living Room • Bathroom • Bedroom • Children’s Rooms • Teen Rooms • Garage • Basement • Attic • Garden • Office • Computer & Technology • Closets • Mail • Sentimental Objects • Photos • Cards & Letters • Music • People This book also helps you • Recognize Clutter • Declutter, clean & organize your home room by room • Sell your things for profit • Shop for a minimalist wardrobe • Get your family on board • Declutter digital content and computer files • Go car-free or car-lite • Surround yourself with people who add value to your life • Maintain your space once you’ve minimalized Living with less is the first step to a peaceful mind. It makes space for the new to come in.

Nurminen","John Impagliazzo"],"publishedDate":"2006-09-15","description":"Through the years, the principal message of the ‘Human Choice and Computers’ (HCC) tradition and its associated conferences has been: there are choices and alternatives. The special theme of HCC7 is Social Informatics, which includes in itself a promise of a less technically biased approach to informatics, whilst An Information Society for All adds the ethical aspects to it. When developing the infrastructure and applications in an information society, we should strive to afford people equal opportunities to information technologies. Professor Rob Kling introduced the name Social informatics in its widely known Computers and Controversy. He was director of the Center for Social Informatics at Indiana University, Bloomington. Unfortunately, he passed away in 2003 at age 58, leaving a rich heritage in the field. This HCC7 conference honours his work and memory, and it develops further the cultivation of Kling’s legacy. In this volume, Social Informatics takes in two directions. The first part supports the readers in creating their interpretation of the meaning of Social Informatics. The second, more extensive, part develops an overview of various applications of Social Informatics. Researchers inspired by Social Informatics touch unbelievably many areas of human and social life. Ethics, culture, politics, and law are a few areas within the realm of Social Informatics. The conceptualisations of information societies and ICT policies expand the domain towards economic, organizational, and technical issues. Additionally, this volume further develops the successful applications that require valid concepts and methods. These aspects demonstrate the power of Rob Kling’s legacy. Scientific knowledge is the most durable form of that heritage because it does not decrease when used; on the contrary, diligent applications bear multiple fruits to continue that legacy. Thank you, Rob! Jacques Berleur is at the University of Namur, Belgium. Markku I. Nurminen is at the University of Turku, Finland.

Authors Carolyn Sobel and Paul Li examine the historical and contemporary issues and research findings of the core cognitive science disciplines: cognitive psychology, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, linguistics, evolutionary psychology, and philosophy. For each of these core disciplines, the historical development and classic research studies are presented in one chapter and current research development and issues follow in a second chapter, offering students a broad understanding of the development of each concentration in the cognitive sciences. The text presents a student-friendly approach to understanding how each discipline has contributed to the growth of cognitive science and the implications for future research. NEW TO THIS EDITION Includes a new chapter on evolutionary psychology, an important emerging field in the cognitive sciences. Offers fully updated research, including subjects such as embodied cognition and extended cognition (philosophy), bilingualism indicating its wide-ranging effects on brain capabilities (linguistics), and current work in neuroplasticity (neuroscience).

This is the 11th in a series of conferences, which started life in Australia, as the computer architecture component of the Australian Computer Science Week. In 1999 it ventured away from its roots for the first time, and the fourth Australasian Computer Architecture Conference was held in the beautiful city of Sails (Auckland, New Zealand). Perhaps it was because of a lack of any other computer architecture conference in Asia or just the attraction of traveling to the Southern Hemisphere but the conference became increasingly international during the subsequent three years and also changed its name to include Computer Systems Architecture, reflecting more the scope of the conference, which embraces both architectural and systems issues. In 2003, the conference again ventured offshore to reflect its constituency and since then has been held in Japan in the beautiful city of Aizu-Wakamatsu, followed by Beijing and Singapore. This year it again returns to China and next year will move to Korea for the first time, where it will be organized by the Korea University.","printType":"BOOK","pageCount":605,"categories":["Computers"],"language":"en","thumbnail":"http://books.google.de/books/content?id=0IY7LW5J4JgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","isbn13":"9783540400561","isbn10":"3540400567"},{"title":"Branding for the Public Sector","subtitle":"Creating, Building and Managing Brands People Will Value","authors":["Paul Temporal"],"publishedDate":"2014-11-20","printType":"BOOK","pageCount":288,"categories":["Business & Economics"],"language":"en","thumbnail":"http://books.google.de/books/content?id=c9GSBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","isbn13":"9781118756256","isbn10":"1118756258"},{"title":"Social Geographies of Educational Change","authors":["F.

Their location in the social space also influences their response to change. In the field of educational change, social space means for example, skin colour, gender distribution of teachers in one school, children’s self-cultural representations or parents’ religious attitudes. By using the notion of Social Geographies in the context of educational change, the authors address the following questions: How initiatives in a classroom or department are influenced by the surrounding context of the school, the district or the nation; How innovation spreads or diffuses from one school to another; How and whether reforms can be scaled up from a few schools to a whole system; How seemingly standardised reforms affect schools differently depending on where they are located; How schools influence one another; How the identities of, and interrelationships among, schools are affected by technology, principles of market competition and choice, and other initiatives.

The authors identify a new force--the emergence of a global production network. Reaching beyond specific companies and countries, this book explores the strategic implications for the Asian-Pacific countries and the United states. Now East Asia is faced with a challenge; they must make the move from low margin hardware business to high margin software and information businesses, while Americans must respond by maintaining leadership in standards, design, marketing, and business innovation.","printType":"BOOK","pageCount":384,"categories":["Computers"],"language":"en","thumbnail":"http://books.google.de/books/content?id=7ceCt71aib4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","isbn13":"9780195352801","isbn10":"0195352807"},{"title":"Dictionary/outline of Basic Statistics","authors":["John E.

Barton"],"publishedDate":"2015-05-15","description":"The hits keep coming for the American legal profession. Law schools are churning out too many graduates, depressing wages, and constricting the hiring market. Big Law firms are crumbling, as the relentless pursuit of profits corrodes their core business model. Modern technology can now handle routine legal tasks like drafting incorporation papers and wills, reducing the need to hire lawyers; tort reform and other regulations on litigation have had the same effect. As in all areas of today's economy, there are some big winners; the rest struggle to find work, or decide to leave the field altogether, which leaves fewer options for consumers who cannot afford to pay for Big Law. It would be easy to look at these enormous challenges and see only a bleak future, but Ben Barton instead sees cause for optimism. Taking the long view, from the legal Wild West of the mid-nineteenth century to the post-lawyer bubble society of the future, he offers a close analysis of the legal market to predict how lawyerly creativity and entrepreneurialism can save the profession. In every seemingly negative development, there is an upside. The trend towards depressed wages and computerized legal work is good for middle class consumers who have not been able to afford a lawyer for years. The surfeit of law school students will correct itself as the law becomes a less attractive and lucrative profession. As Big Law shrinks, so will the pernicious influence of billable hours, which incentivize lawyers to spend as long as possible on every task, rather than seeking efficiency and economy. Lawyers will devote their time to work that is much more challenging and meaningful. None of this will happen without serious upheaval, but all of it will ultimately restore the health of the faltering profession. A unique contribution to our understanding of the legal crisis, the unconventional wisdom of Glass Half Full gives cause for hope in what appears to be a hopeless situation.","printType":"BOOK","pageCount":320,"categories":["Law"],"language":"en","thumbnail":"http://books.google.de/books/content?id=rvbzCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","isbn13":"9780190205577","isbn10":"0190205571"},{"title":"PROLOG, children and students","authors":["Jon Nichol","Jonathan Briggs","Jackie Dean"],"publishedDate":"1988-05","printType":"BOOK","pageCount":217,"categories":["Education"],"language":"en","thumbnail":"http://books.google.de/books/content?id=FphLAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","isbn13":"","isbn10":""},{"title":"The role of semiconductor inputs in IT hardware price decline","subtitle":"computers vs. communications","authors":["Ana M.

Encyclopedia of Security Management is a complete reference for security managers, encompassing topics in administration, specialized security functions, and technology. Continuous learning is required of security managers who are determined to stay current. The area of electronic technology, with its myriad of security applications, has practically exploded in recent years. The product of this rapid evolution is specialization, which can be both positive and negative. The usual experience of a security practitioner is to spend formative years in a relatively specialized area, such as supervising contract guard services, conducting investigations, or installing alarm systems. When promoted to a managerial level, the individual brings to the new job a limited, one dimensional viewpoint. With coverage of the A to Z topics concerning security managers, this volume describes the basics of each topic and the information needed to apply this knowledge to any reader's job, business, or industry. In addition, the book's sample policies, procedures, guides, forms, checklists and drawings can be easily converted for a security manager's use.","printType":"BOOK","pageCount":792,"categories":["Industries"],"language":"en","thumbnail":"http://books.google.de/books/content?id=SypaAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","isbn13":"","isbn10":""},{"title":"Computer literacy in higher education","authors":["Francis E.

Our goal is to understand the processes which account for the ordinary flow of talk that happens all the time between speakers and lis teners. How do conversations happen? What is needed by a listener to follow a speaker's words and respond appropriately to them? How much can a speaker take for granted and how much must be stated explicitly for the listener to follow the speaker's meanings readily and easily? Each time we ask these questions, we seem to have to go back to some place prior to the \"ordinary\" adult conversation. This time, we have tried reversing the questions and asking: What happens when conversa tion fails? Prompted in part by an early paper by Robin Lakoff to the Chi cago Linguistics Society and by Herb Clark's studies of listener processes, we wondered what a speaker has to do to make the listener finally stop making allowances and stop trying to adjust the conversational contract to cooperate. This inquiry led us to the schizophrenic speaker. When a listener decides that the speaker's talk is \"crazy,\" he or she is giving up on the normal form of conversation and saying, in effect, this talk is ex traordinary and something is wrong. We thought that, if we could specify what makes a conversation fail, we might learn what has to be present for a conversation to succeed.","printType":"BOOK","pageCount":229,"categories":["Language Arts & Disciplines"],"language":"en","thumbnail":"http://books.google.de/books/content?id=uDSgBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","isbn13":"9781461591191","isbn10":"1461591198"},{"title":"A Bibliographic Guide to Resources in Scientific Computing, 1945-1975","authors":["Jeffrey R.

These standards have been developed and implemented in almost all facets of the educational environment, including educational technology. This study was designed to determine if New Jersey teachers' perceptions of their own technology use reflect the National Educational Technology Standards for Teachers (NETS-T). Using quantitative methods, the results demonstrate that New Jersey teachers' perceptions are highly aligned with the NETS-T. Additionally, teacher responses were grouped based on years in education, subject area taught, grade level taught, and district factor grouping designation. Using ANOVAs, these groups were analyzed independently to determine if statistically significant differences existed within each group. Finally, it was determined that a statistically significant increase in score was present if teachers were aware of the existence of the standards, and had read and understood the standards.","printType":"BOOK","pageCount":117,"language":"en","thumbnail":"http://books.google.de/books/content?id=66pEHlcQF60C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","isbn13":"9780549703457","isbn10":"0549703454"},{"title":"The 1:1 Roadmap","subtitle":"Setting the Course for Innovation in Education","authors":["Andrew P.

In Digital Archaeology, expert practitioner Michael Graves has written the most thorough, realistic, and up-to-date guide to the principles and techniques of modern digital forensics. Graves begins by providing a solid understanding of the legal underpinnings of and critical laws affecting computer forensics, including key principles of evidence and case law. Next, he explains how to systematically and thoroughly investigate computer systems to unearth crimes or other misbehavior, and back it up with evidence that will stand up in court. Drawing on the analogy of archaeological research, Graves explains each key tool and method investigators use to reliably uncover hidden information in digital systems. His detailed demonstrations often include the actual syntax of command-line utilities. Along the way, he presents exclusive coverage of facilities management, a full chapter on the crucial topic of first response to a digital crime scene, and up-to-the-minute coverage of investigating evidence in the cloud. Graves concludes by presenting coverage of important professional and business issues associated with building a career in digital forensics, including current licensing and certification requirements. Topics Covered Include Acquiring and analyzing data in ways consistent with forensic procedure Recovering and examining e-mail, Web, and networking activity Investigating users’ behavior on mobile devices Overcoming anti-forensics measures that seek to prevent data capture and analysis Performing comprehensive electronic discovery in connection with lawsuits Effectively managing cases and documenting the evidence you find Planning and building your career in digital forensics Digital Archaeology is a key resource for anyone preparing for a career as a professional investigator; for IT professionals who are sometimes called upon to assist in investigations; and for those seeking an explanation of the processes involved in preparing an effective defense, including how to avoid the legally indefensible destruction of digital evidence.","printType":"BOOK","pageCount":600,"categories":["Computers"],"language":"en","thumbnail":"http://books.google.de/books/content?id=BYNuAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","isbn13":"9780132853798","isbn10":"0132853795"},{"title":"Railroad Technology and Manpower in the 1970's","authors":["Richard Johnson"],"publishedDate":"1972","description":"Technological change, productivity measures and employment outlook.","printType":"BOOK","pageCount":90,"categories":["Railroads"],"language":"en","thumbnail":"http://books.google.de/books/content?id=fIFnsjybbbEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","isbn13":"","isbn10":""}],[{"title":"Social Interaction in Second Language Chat Rooms","authors":["Christopher Jenks"],"publishedDate":"2014-03-31","description":"How do speakers of English as an additional language manage their talk and interaction in chat rooms?

Barton"],"publishedDate":"2015-05-15","description":"The hits keep coming for the American legal profession. Law schools are churning out too many graduates, depressing wages, and constricting the hiring market. Big Law firms are crumbling, as the relentless pursuit of profits corrodes their core business model. Modern technology can now handle routine legal tasks like drafting incorporation papers and wills, reducing the need to hire lawyers; tort reform and other regulations on litigation have had the same effect. As in all areas of today's economy, there are some big winners; the rest struggle to find work, or decide to leave the field altogether, which leaves fewer options for consumers who cannot afford to pay for Big Law. It would be easy to look at these enormous challenges and see only a bleak future, but Ben Barton instead sees cause for optimism. Taking the long view, from the legal Wild West of the mid-nineteenth century to the post-lawyer bubble society of the future, he offers a close analysis of the legal market to predict how lawyerly creativity and entrepreneurialism can save the profession. In every seemingly negative development, there is an upside. The trend towards depressed wages and computerized legal work is good for middle class consumers who have not been able to afford a lawyer for years. The surfeit of law school students will correct itself as the law becomes a less attractive and lucrative profession. As Big Law shrinks, so will the pernicious influence of billable hours, which incentivize lawyers to spend as long as possible on every task, rather than seeking efficiency and economy. Lawyers will devote their time to work that is much more challenging and meaningful. None of this will happen without serious upheaval, but all of it will ultimately restore the health of the faltering profession. A unique contribution to our understanding of the legal crisis, the unconventional wisdom of Glass Half Full gives cause for hope in what appears to be a hopeless situation.","printType":"BOOK","pageCount":320,"categories":["Law"],"language":"en","thumbnail":"http://books.google.de/books/content?id=rvbzCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","isbn13":"9780190205577","isbn10":"0190205571"},{"title":"GO! with Microsoft Office 2003","subtitle":"Brief : with Additional Microsoft Excel","publishedDate":"2004-01-01","printType":"BOOK","pageCount":1328,"categories":["Computers"],"language":"en","thumbnail":"http://books.google.de/books/content?id=Ffz3_dxxmO8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","isbn13":"9780536831576","isbn10":"0536831572"},{"title":"Surfen im Seichten","subtitle":"Was das Internet mit unserem Hirn anstellt","authors":["Nicholas G.

Rapid technological change in communications, computing, and information management continue to promise further gains in productivity, a phenomenon often referred to as the New Economy. To better understand this phenomenon, the National Academies Board on Science, Technology, and Economic Policy (STEP) has convened a series of workshops and commissioned papers on Measuring and Sustaining the New Economy. This major workshop, entitled Deconstructing the Computer, brought together leading industrialists and academic researchers to explore the contribution of the different components of computers to improved price-performance and quality of information systems. The objective was to help understand the sources of the remarkable growth of American productivity in the 1990s, the relative contributions of computers and their underlying components, and the evolution and future contributions of the technologies supporting this positive economic performance.","printType":"BOOK","pageCount":182,"categories":["Business & Economics"],"language":"en","thumbnail":"http://books.google.de/books/content?id=9KGcAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","isbn13":"9780309092548","isbn10":"030909254X"}],[{"title":"Public Policy and the Internet: Privacy, Taxes, and Contract","printType":"BOOK","language":"en","thumbnail":"http://books.google.de/books/content?id=cDUusyyatYMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","isbn13":"9780817998936","isbn10":"0817998934"},{"title":"PROLOG, children and students","authors":["Jon Nichol","Jonathan Briggs","Jackie Dean"],"publishedDate":"1988-05","printType":"BOOK","pageCount":217,"categories":["Education"],"language":"en","thumbnail":"http://books.google.de/books/content?id=FphLAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","isbn13":"","isbn10":""},{"title":"The role of semiconductor inputs in IT hardware price decline","subtitle":"computers vs. communications","authors":["Ana M.

Encyclopedia of Security Management is a complete reference for security managers, encompassing topics in administration, specialized security functions, and technology. Continuous learning is required of security managers who are determined to stay current. The area of electronic technology, with its myriad of security applications, has practically exploded in recent years. The product of this rapid evolution is specialization, which can be both positive and negative. The usual experience of a security practitioner is to spend formative years in a relatively specialized area, such as supervising contract guard services, conducting investigations, or installing alarm systems. When promoted to a managerial level, the individual brings to the new job a limited, one dimensional viewpoint. With coverage of the A to Z topics concerning security managers, this volume describes the basics of each topic and the information needed to apply this knowledge to any reader's job, business, or industry. In addition, the book's sample policies, procedures, guides, forms, checklists and drawings can be easily converted for a security manager's use.","printType":"BOOK","pageCount":792,"categories":["Industries"],"language":"en","thumbnail":"http://books.google.de/books/content?id=SypaAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","isbn13":"","isbn10":""},{"title":"Computer literacy in higher education","authors":["Francis E.
